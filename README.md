# Hello World
We are NFTEEZUS. A collective of data artists, scientists, and engineers supervising computers that create art. As pieces are ready they are assembled into releases which are comprised of drops and items. 

### Releases
Releases are groupings of pieces created by our computers. Each release is based off of the same data set, and typically themed similarly. There will never be a rerelease or revisit of any of our themes. 

### Drops
Optionally, each release might have drops to spread out the enslaught of data-art. The size and frequency of these drops are typically determined by data within the release. 

### Items
Items are the the actual pieces created by our computers which are tokenized and offered for sale. Each item is unique and will only ever be created and sold by us once.
